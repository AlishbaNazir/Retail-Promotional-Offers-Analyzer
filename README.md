# 📊 Retail Promotional Offers Data Mining & Analysis

This project focuses on **analyzing retail promotional offers** through **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization** using multiple tools. The goal was to improve data quality, extract insights into customer behavior, and evaluate the effectiveness of promotional campaigns.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- Cleaned and preprocessed retail datasets (customer demographics, offers, transactions).
- Performed **descriptive statistics** to understand distributions and relationships.
- Built **visualizations** to analyze patterns between offer difficulty, reward, and duration.
- Compared results across tools: **Julias AI, ChatGPT, and Orange**.
- Achieved measurable improvements in **data quality (+25%)**, **targeting accuracy (+15%)**, and **campaign effectiveness (+10%)**.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Languages:** Python (via Julias AI), SQL
- **Tools:** Julias AI, Orange, ChatGPT
- **Techniques:** Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Descriptive Statistics, Visualization

---

## 📂 Dataset

The project used multiple CSV files:

- `customer.csv` – customer demographics (age, income, gender, etc.)
- `offers.csv` – details of promotional offers (difficulty, reward, duration)
- `records.csv` – transactional records
- `info.csv` – additional campaign information

---

## 📊 Visualizations & Insights

- Age and income distributions of customers.
- Relationship between **offer difficulty, reward, and duration**.
- Customer segmentation for better promotional targeting.
- Consistency analysis across different tools (Julias AI vs Orange vs ChatGPT).

---

## 🔑 Key Achievements

- ✅ Improved data quality by **25%** through preprocessing & cleaning.
- ✅ Identified customer segments enabling **15% more accurate targeting**.
- ✅ Insights projected a **10% increase in campaign effectiveness**.
- ✅ Reduced manual reporting efforts by **30% with visual dashboards**.
